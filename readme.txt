A to do List inspired in the Angela Yu's project from her course at Udemy.

Firstly, I've coded following just her commands, without seeing any hints.

Beyond that, I have implemented some design improvements and a side navbar witch allows the user to see, access, create and delete lists.

I deployed the app on Heroku:
